# Customer Service Application - Project1

This is a C++ project focused on implementing core data structure and system design concepts using a simulated FASTQ file processing environment. It involves building and testing a **linked list** and managing dynamic memory safely, all while working in a Linux development environment.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a **linked list** data structure from scratch.
- Practice **C++ dynamic memory management**, including:
  - Avoiding memory leaks
  - Preventing double frees
  - Guarding against segmentation faults
- Develop **unit tests** to validate functionality.
- Gain experience working in a **Linux-based development environment**.
- Practice analyzing, understanding, and meeting **software requirements**.
